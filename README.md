# Vigen-re-Cipher-Encryption-and-Decryption
This project provides an implementation of the Vigenère cipher for encrypting and decrypting text. It also includes a frequency analysis tool for breaking Vigenère cipher with unknown keys by comparing the letter frequency distribution of the ciphertext to the typical English letter frequency distribution.
